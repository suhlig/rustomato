I am learning Rust by implementing a simple [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer.

# Usage

```command
$ rustomato pomodoro [start]   # Starts a new Pomodoro. Auto-finishes the currently active break if there is one.
$ rustomato pomodoro annotate  # Annotates aÂ¹ Pomodoro.
$ rustomato pomodoro interrupt # Mark aÂ¹ Pomodoro as interrupted.
$ rustomato pomodoro log       # Log a previously finished pomodoro.
$ rustomato break [start]      # Starts a break. Auto-finishes the currently active Pomodoro if there is one.
```
[1] the running, if there is one, or the most recently completed, or the given

`pomodoro` and `break` will block until the time is over. If the command is interrupted with Control-C (`SIGINT`), the currently running Pomodoro is cancelled immediately. If a break is currently running, it is finished.

The possible application states are valid for an instance of the database (as pointed to by `$RUSTOMATO_DATABASE_URL`, which defaults to `$RUSTOMATO_ROOT/data.db`):

  ![Application States](doc/statemachine.drawio.svg)

The default for `$RUSTOMATO_ROOT` is `$HOME/.rustomato`.

## Hooks

> WIP

Until we have them, here is how to use notifications:

```command
$ rustomato pomodoro start && terminal-notifier -message "Pomodoro is over" -title rustomato -sound glass -group rustomato || terminal-notifier -message "Pomodoro cancelled" -title rustomato -sound glass -group rustomato
```

If you prefer tmux:

```command
$ rustomato pomodoro start && tmux display-message "Pomodoro is over" || tmux display-message "Pomodoro cancelled"
```

Or, on a Mac:

```command
$ rustomato pomodoro start && say "Pomodoro is over" || say "Pomodoro cancelled"
```

# Development

* Install and update rust with `rustup`
* Run tests with `cargo test`
  - use `cargo watch -x test` for fast iteration
  - install the plugin with `cargo install cargo-watch`
* Run the app: `cargo run -- pomodoro`
* Build a release manually with `cargo build --release` (binary will be found in `target/release/`)

# TODO

* `rustomato pomodoro interrupt` sends `SIGUSR1` to the currently running `rustomato` process (use [signal-hook](https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook) for that)
* Show progress bar only when attached to a terminal
* Annotations table, joined onto Pomodori
* Interrupts table, joined onto Pomodori
* Add DB constraint to ensure that `finished_at`, if not nil, must be >= `started_at`
* Add DB constraint to ensure that `cancelled_at`, if not nil, must be >= `started_at`
